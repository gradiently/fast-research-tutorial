# How to Research a Topic 101

## Chanllenges
* 🏁 You don't have the luxury of `TIME`, research are usually counted in days and hours, not in years.
* Your chance of bringing your idea to bigger audiance isn't fat, yes, you can have your voice, but you usually have to deliver a concept, or prove your idea in minutes. ⏱️
* Every engineer has ideas, in fact majority of us have duplicating ideas, you uniqueness is a thing you have to earn.
* Don't imagine you're a trained operative in a mission, there won't be a guy in the chair on your ear piece, and no air assistant to bomb any enemy in your way, usually you do most of the tasks along.

## The Purpose of This Tutorial
* How to leverage the limited time & resource to bring the largest impact.
* Features of great hackers.
* Tricks to make our coding life easier. (Especially for python)

## The Worst Nightmares for Your Line Manager
* Wow you used a lots of time on a task, hard or not.
* But your deliverable is hard to describe or quantify, metrics are vague
* Your task is straightforward, but seems it has a lot of dependencies

## When Start A Project
### Tighten the Scope
Tightening the scope, is mostly for mantally manage your drive.

Make sure your core logic / points can be:
* reduce into 1~3 charts
* reduce into 1~3 numbers
* reduce into 1~3 **functions**

### Spot the Time / Resource Black Hole
🌌 Let me introduce you many nafarious black holes:

#### 📦 Setup Environment
python library verison conflicts (between libraries and between environments) can bring many senior engineers to knees.

#### 🧽 Getting / Cleaning Data
Especially for new domains where you haven't tried before

#### 🔥 Maintaining Any Online Server
It will horn your production skill, but also kill your time like crazy.

#### 🤹 Interactive UI
It's great to demo your idea, but full on HTML JS UI x Python really take time.

All above traps are still huge time traps even if you keep asking GPT.

## What We Do?
### ✨ Out of box environment
* Anaconda
* Google Colab, 1 button click save to github, 1 button click load from github
* Enterprise Colab in GCP
* Kaggle (Data native), Loads of templates

### 🍳 Cheap Interactivity
* ipywidgets
* Streamlit

### 💣 Leave a Mark, Make a Dent
No matter you left an impact or not, leave a mark, inform of
#### 📹 Screen Recording
* `CMD + Shift + 5` on Mac
* Save the `mov` file to company `google drive`
* `google drive` videos can be played with youtube's video player, so your coworker can watch with `CC` on and 2x speed. 
* Contain your own beautiful voice to expain things.
* It's good speech drill when you record it (in some cases take you more than 1 time) before official demo.
* Imagine 1 year later, some leadership mentioned they want something they see from other companies, but you worked on before! or some coworker is claiming some dumb idea you've already proven false! Your streamlit & other python stuff might not be running anytime soon, but your video is there! You can share your video by then.

#### 📜 Various Forms of Documentation
* Markdown in github
* Markdown in issue (quoting code easier)
* Confluence
After those, post the link to your self describe with some keyword ( so busy ones like us, if forgotten can search chat history to find the link, and forward it to people)

#### 🚲 Reuseable Functions
* You / Other Engineers can keep reuse
* A template people can fashion new things out of.
